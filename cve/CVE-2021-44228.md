## Short description
This vulnerability is related to the [CVE-2021-44228][1] vulnerability (also known as "[Log4Shell][2]") in the Log4j Java 
library. This library is part of the embedded Elasticsearch instance in Linkurious Enterprise.

## Severity: Medium
The vulnerability in Linkurious Enterprise is Medium.
The Log4j vulnerability in Elasticsearch can be exploited by actors able to write arbitrary data in your graph database, or 
by actors who have access to the local server where Linkurious Enterprise is installed, and are able to send arbitrary HTTP queries
to the local netowork interface of the server.

## Who is affected?
Users of Linkurious Enterprise prior to v3.0.6 who are using the **embedded Elasticsearch** are affected.
To test for that, open your configuration file (`data/config/production.json`) and look for 
entries under `dataSources.*.index.vendor` with a value of `"elasticSearch"` (not `"elasticSearch2"`). 
If you have any data-source with the index vendor `"elasticSearch"`, you are affected.

## What is the impact?
From [Elastic's public communication][3]:
> Elasticsearch is not susceptible to remote code execution with this vulnerability due to our use of the Java Security Manager.
> Elasticsearch on JDK8 or below is susceptible to an information leak via DNS which is fixed by a simple JVM property change.
> The information leak does not permit access to data within the Elasticsearch cluster.

As far as we understand, this means that the content of environment variables from the server on which Linkurious Enterprise is
installed could be leaked.

Note that Linkurious Enterprise's embedded Elasticsearch does not listen for external connections, but only for local 
connections (i.e. it does not bind to `0.0.0.0` but to `127.0.0.1`). This limits the risk to attackers who already
have access to the server hosting Linkurious Enterprise.

## How can it be patched?
For users of **Linkurious Enterprise 2.10**: do not use the embedded Elasticsearch. Switch to "Neo4j search" or to an external
Elasticsearch cluster with a recent version.
For users of **Linkurious Enterprise 3.0**: update to [Linkurious Enterprise v3.0.8][7] or later.

## Other Log4j-related vulnerabilities
- CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046: both these issues are fixed by following the above instructions 
- CVE-2021-45105: Elasticsearch is not affected by this vulnerability 

source: [official Elasticsearch statement][3]

## Updating to a fixed version
- [Linkurious Enterprise v3.0.6][7] has been released on 2021-12-06 and fixes the vulnerability for new deployments.
- [Linkurious Enterprise v3.0.7][7] has been released on 2022-01-20 and fixes the vulnerability for **new and existing** deployments.
- [Linkurious Enterprise v3.0.8][7] has been released on 2022-02-10 and is not vulnerable anymore (it uses [Elasticsearch 7.16.3][8] internally)

## Other recommendations
If you are using Linkurious Enterprise in combination with Neo4j, please folow the [instructions provided by Neo4j][4].
If you are using Linkurious Enterprise in combination with you own Elasticsearch cluster, please follow the [instructions provided by Elastic][3].
