# Linkurious Customer Center

The [Linkurious Customer Center](https://get.linkurio.us/) is the official Linkurious portal where our customers and partners can handle their projects.

Based on the user's role, this may include the possibility to download the software, access license informations, 
contact the support channel and more.

Some main contacts get an invitation to create an account during the initial interactions with our company.
Those people will then be autonomous in inviting other team members.

Here some helpful procedures:
