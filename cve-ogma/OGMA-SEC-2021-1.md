# OGMA-SEC-2021-1

## Timeline
- 2021-08-09 A customer inquires Linkurious about an `unsafe-eval` error when using a custom `Content-Security-Policy` header
- 2021-08-11 Linkurious relates the problem to the Ogma library and discloses this assessment
- 2021-09-29 Ogma v3.4.6 is released, patching the vulnerability

## Description
The Ogma library contains code which relies on the `eval` function to dynamically generate some code.
The use of such a function is usually considered unsafe as it can allow the execution of malicious code.

## Impact
The Ogma library does not use the `eval` function on any user input, making it impossible to execute any non official code.
However specific security policies may prevent applications using the Ogma library to work properly.

## Severity: Info
- No patch is necessary unless specific errors.

## Who is affected?
All applications using a version of Ogma older than v3.4.6 with a `Content-Security-Policy` now allowing `unsafe-eval`.

## How can it be patched?
- Update to Ogma v3.4.6 or later.
